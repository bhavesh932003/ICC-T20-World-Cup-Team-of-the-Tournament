# ICC-T20-World-Cup-Team-of-the-Tournament
This is project made by me wherein I determined the TEAM OF THE TOURNAMENT for ICC T20 World Cup 2022 using the stats of the all the players and all the teams from ESPNCRICINFO which I scrapped.
Then I cleaned and organized the data (present as json file) on jupyter notebook using the libraries of python and then downloaded their csv files.
Then I loaded the data on POWER BI and created 4 different files namely batting summary, bowling summary, player info and match summary and linked each matching column using model view.
Then I calculated necessary measures for the creation of dashboard including batting average, bowling strike rate, average balls faced etc.
Then I created the dashboard for the Team of the Tournament which includes pages of power hitters,middle order, allrounders, lower order and fast bowlers using the specific criterias for each category and then created the final 11 including 2 openers, 3 middle order batsmen, 2 allrounders and 4 fast bowlers.
I implemented various features of Power BI such as buttons (specifying their action (page navigation)) and also used tool tips to present the summary of players for the whole tournament.
